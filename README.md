# etch-a-sketch

Build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch using html, css, and javascript. The sketchpad will be a grid with sides measuring anywhere from 2 - 100, determined by user input. Squares will change color as the mouse pointer passes over them.

Pseudo-code:
Creating the grid:
    Variables for:
        -grid dimensions
        -creating a square (div)
        -divRow will contain (n)width divs

    Get input for grid dimensions.
    Create (n) divs.
    Place (n) divs in divRow.
    Create (n) divRows.

    Use flexbox to space divs/divRows correctly using classes.
